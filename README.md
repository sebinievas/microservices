# microservices

The `client-old` directory is the files I extracted I believe from an "original.zip" resource file that was downloaded.
* I attempted to create a fresh react-app just in case it was a version issue.
* I am able to run `npm start` from the client folder on my local machine just fine.
* Also, note that I changed the hostname from `posts.com` to `posts.dev` as another attempt. It didn't make a difference.
* I am able to reach with postman `posts.dev/posts/create` and create the record successfully.. this tells me the routes setup in ingress are correct, I just can't get the react client to load properly at `/`
